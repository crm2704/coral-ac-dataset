# CORAL-AC: ODRL Hospital Access Control Policy Dataset

This repository contains the **CORAL-AC dataset**, a curated collection of hospital access control policies originally implemented using **Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL** and manually translated into the **Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)**.

The dataset was created to support **reproducible research on semantic policy modelling, policy evaluation, policy recommendation, and policy engine validation**, particularly in regulated domains such as healthcare where transparency, interoperability, and auditability are essential.

Each policy is provided in **four aligned representations**:

- Natural language description
- PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) rule
- ODRL policy expressed in JSON-LD
- ODRL+ODRE policy expressed in JSON-LD

Additionally, the dataset includes **evaluation artefacts** following the conceptual model proposed in the **ODRL formal semantics**, including:

- evaluation requests
- contextual states of the world
- expected evaluation outcomes

The repository is intended to facilitate benchmarking, formal analysis, and comparative evaluation of policy enforcement mechanisms. These artefacts allow **independent validation of ODRL policy evaluators without requiring the original relational infrastructure**. 


The dataset accompanies the scientific article:

> **CORAL-AC: A Dataset of Hospital Access Control Policies for ODRL Evaluation**  
> OPAL Workshop 2026 — ODRL and beyond: practical applications and challenges for policy-base access and usage control

## Dataset Structure

Each policy is contained in its own directory organized as follows:

````
PXX_<Policy_Title>/
├── rls.sql
├── odrl.jsonld
├── odre.jsonld
├── policy.txt
├── evaluation_requests/
│ ├── PXX-n.jsonld
│ └── ...
├── sow/
│ ├── statePXX-n.jsonld
│ └── ...
├── evaluation_requests_index.json
├── state_of_world.json (optional)
````


- `rls.sql` — PostgreSQL RLS rules corresponding to the policy.
- `odrl.jsonld` — ODRL policy encoded in JSON-LD.
- `odre.json` — ODRL policy encoded in JSON-LD using ODRE.
- `policy.txt` — Natural language description of the policy.
- `evaluation_requests/` — One evaluation request per test case in JSON-LD.
- `evaluation_requests_index.json` — Mapping from case identifiers (e.g., `P01-1`) to individual evaluation request files.
- `state_of_world.json` — Contextual state definitions for cases where the state is non-empty.
- `dataset_description.json` — Dataset metadata at the repository root.

## Evaluation Setting

Each policy is accompanied by explicitly defined evaluation requests and expected outcomes. The dataset therefore supports:

- Benchmarking of ODRL evaluators,
- Formal semantic analysis,
- Compliance verification experiments,
- Cross-language policy translation (RLS ↔ ODRL ↔ Natural Language),
- Policy recommendation and synthesis research.

The inclusion of contextual state definitions where applicable enables reproducible testing under controlled conditions.
